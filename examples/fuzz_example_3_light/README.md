# Fuzz Test Example for Trident Fuzzer

---

## Program and Errors Description

- ### Initialize
    - Within the Initialize instruction, we initialize a new Escrow Transaction. The entered amount (as instruction input) is locked within the Escrow Token Account for a specified amount of time (also as instruction input). Later, this amount can be partially or fully unlocked based on the current time during Withdrawal.

- ### Withdraw
    - Within the Withdrawal function, we can unlock the locked amount. The condition is that the eligible recipient, stored as Recipient PubKey within the Escrow Account, has to sign the Transaction.
    - ❗ **NOTE:** 🐛 One issue is that within the **amount_unlocked function**, we do not correctly compute the unlocked amount, resulting in:
        - In some cases, the receiver **🚨can withdraw less🚨** than intended, due to the use of integer arithmetic, which rounds everything down.
        - As multiple Escrows share one Token Account per Mint, it is also **🚨possible to withdraw more🚨** than intended, potentially leading to the **🚨unauthorized withdrawal🚨** of funds belonging to other customers.
        - If the **unlocked_amount** is greater than the initially locked amount and the Token Account has insufficient balance, **🚨the Recipient will not be able to withdraw any funds🚨**.

## Fuzz Test Checks
- ### ✔️Withdraw Instruction Checks
We first verify that the Escrow Account was initialized before the Instruction call; if so, we can read the Recipient Public Key from the Account.
```rust
if let Some(escrow) = pre_ix.escrow {
    let recipient = pre_ix.recipient.unwrap();
}
```
Next, we ensure that the Recipient Token Account was already initialized before the Instruction call and also unwrap the Token Account after the Instruction.
```rust
if let Some(recepient_token_account_pre) = pre_ix.recipient_token_account
if let Some(recepient_token_account_post) = post_ix.recipient_token_account
```
We then need to verify that the Signer corresponds to the Recipient stored within the Escrow Account.
```rust
if escrow.recipient == *recipient.key
```
- #### Branch 1️⃣
We check if the Recipient's balance within his Token Account did not change.
```rust
if recepient_token_account_pre.amount
    == recepient_token_account_post.amount
```
If so, he was not able to withdraw the locked amount, thus we found the 🚨Error🚨
```rust
return Err("Recipient was not able to withdraw any funds");
```
- #### Branch 2️⃣
This branch indicates that the Recipient was able to withdraw something, but not the expected amount.
```rust
else if recepient_token_account_pre.amount + escrow.amount
    != recepient_token_account_post.amount
```
- ##### Option🅰️
We check if he actually withdrew **Less**
```rust
if recepient_token_account_pre.amount + escrow.amount
> recepient_token_account_post.amount
```
If so, we found the 🚨Error🚨
```rust
// ...
// "Amount Mismatch (Recipient withdrew LESS) by: ...
// ...
return Err("Transfered amount mismatch");
```
- ##### Option🅱️
Alternatively, if he was able to withdraw **MORE** than intended, we again found the 🚨Error🚨.
```rust
// ...
// "Amount Mismatch (Recipient withdrew MORE) by: ...
// ...
return Err("Transfered amount mismatch");
```
<u> Final Check </u>
```rust
if let Some(escrow) = pre_ix.escrow {

    let recipient = pre_ix.recipient.unwrap();

    if let Some(recepient_token_account_pre) = pre_ix.recipient_token_account {

        if let Some(recepient_token_account_post) = post_ix.recipient_token_account {

            if escrow.recipient == *recipient.key {

                if recepient_token_account_pre.amount == recepient_token_account_post.amount {

                    return Err("Recipient was not able to withdraw any funds");

                } else if recepient_token_account_pre.amount + escrow.amount != recepient_token_account_post.amount {

                    if recepient_token_account_pre.amount + escrow.amount > recepient_token_account_post.amount {
                        return Err("Recipient withdrew LESS");
                    } else {

                        // print info within debug mode
                        // eprintln!("Before: {}", recepient_token_account_pre.amount);
                        return Err("Recipient withdrew MORE");


                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
